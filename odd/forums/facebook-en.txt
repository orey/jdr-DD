Hi guyz,
I just finished to translate the psionic part of the Supplement III Eldritch Wizardry of OD&D in French. Yes, that's a first, this supplement was never translated as far as I know.
The document contains:

    The complete translation of the psionic part in French, with all the original fonts and layout,
    The references of this section to ther sections of OD&D, Greyhawk and Eldritch Wizardry, in order to understand better how the psionic powers of OD&D relate to older manuals,
    An attempt of rewriting of the rules in order to make them more understandable.

Indeed, I saw online that I was not the only one to find this rule set a bit hard to grasp.
All is OGL and free, for sure, because it is a fan's work not to be sold.
If the French version of OD&D psionic powers are of some interest to you, help yourselves...
